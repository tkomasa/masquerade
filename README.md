This is step 1 in a simulation project for fun. This part will simulate choices and create datasets for me.

- creating an npc
- values of an npc
- choosing a job and why we have these values
- end goal of actually completing the job
- random generation of npc
- szudzik vs cantor pairing functions
- use cases
